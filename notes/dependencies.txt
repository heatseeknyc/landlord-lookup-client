Need to make a note about the following external dependencies, which obviously come from elsewhere but which we maintain locally cached copies of: 

  html/vendor/js/jquery.easytabs.js
  html/vendor/js/jquery.easytabs.min.js
  html/vendor/js/jquery.geocomplete.js
  html/vendor/js/jquery.geocomplete.min.js
  html/vendor/js/jquery.hashchange.min.js
