        <h3>About the NYC Landlord Lookup tool</h3>
        The <strong>NYC Landlord Lookup</strong> tool was created to provide easy access to
        3 major open data sets regarding property ownership which are of general interest to NYC residents, 
        but which (as of early 2016) are not easily accessible via the City's websites.

        It is an open source project sponsored by <a href="https://heatseeknyc.com">Heat Seek NYC</a>
        and maintained by volunteers.
        <h3>Data Sources</h3>

        <h4>Taxbill Summaries</h4>
        ...
        <h4>DHCR Rent Stablization Status</h4>
        ...
        <h4>HPD Registered Contacts</h4>
        ...
        <h3>Correctness and Completeness</h3>

        Best efforts have been made to present the city's datasets as-is, and importantly, to avoid
        innacurate record matches.  That said, the city's datasets themselves are, we have found, simply 
        broken in various ways for a small but significant portion of properties (around 1-2% for each source, 
        compounding to about 5% across all sources combined).  To the extent that we've been able to identify 
        this "brokenness", we've chosen to omit certain properties and buildings from our searches 
        (rather than return false or ambiguous matches). <p>

        So if you've typed an address that you're pretty sure corresponds to a property you know
        about directly, but aren't gettting at least lat/lon hit and basic ownership status, that's
        the most likely reason.  Specific datasets also have gaps in coverage, as detailed in the 
        section on <strong>Data Sources</strong> above.<p>
        
        (Further description of dataset accuracy needed).
