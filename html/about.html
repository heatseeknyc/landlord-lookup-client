        <h3>So what is this?</h3>
        The <strong>NYC Landlord Lookup</strong> is an experimental tool  
        created to provide easy access to various information sources in the NYC real estate 
        data ecosystem (some well known, others not well-known).  It's a project run by volunteers, 
        and ultimately intended to be open source.

        <h3>Features and Scope</h3>
        It doesn't do a whole lot, at present -- but what it does do, it tries to do
        very accurately.  The primary area of focus is on what we call the "backbone" 
        (making sense of, and smoothing over gaps in the City's somewhat archaic numbering 
        system for tax lots and buildings), and on (rigorously) identifying current
        property ownership.  Importantly, it aims to capture <em>every</em> taxlot and building
        in the system, and to work on any (reasonably) valid address or property identifier
        you might wish to feed it in the search bar.
        <p>

        And the second area of focus is on identifying properties that have some form
        of rent stabilization (or are otherwise enrolled with the city as "affordiable"). 
        This is somewhat tricky (especially in regard to identifying stabilized properties),
        because while it's easy to tell if a building <em>might</em> be stabilized,   
        to tell whether it actually <em>is</em> stabilized you have to cross-check various 
        obscure datasets.  So far as we know, this the only search portal that provides 
        this category of information.<p>

        And finally, we put it all on a map.  Because everyone likes looking at maps.

        <h3>Credits</h3>

        Currently the portal makes use of some 25+ datasets, taken from various city agencies.
        We'll be providing a detailed list in the near future, but special credit and thanks
        go to:
        <ul>

              <a class="invite" href="https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/">hosting</a> most of the city-provided datasets
              <li> <a class="invite" href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doitt/initiatives/open-data-law.page">Local Law 11 of 2012</a>
                  (aka the "Open Data Law") for making those datasets possible 
          <li> <a class="invite" href="http://blog.johnkrauss.com/">John Krauss</a> for his crucial DOF taxbill 
              scrapes (which provide the most current and detailed counts of stabilized 
              properties and units, "in the large").
        </ul>

        <h3>Usage + Caveats</h3> 
        By this point most address searches seem to go through, and when they go through
        they're quite accurate (if in fact they describe a valid address).  That said we're 
        currently entirely dependent on the City's Geoclient services to do the actual
        address-to-BBL conversion -- which, while quite good, has been seen to fail on 
        valid addresses, occasionally.<p>

        And when it does identify a property, there are still various glitches in the 
        city's numbering system -- particularly as applies to recently built or demolished
        buildings, and recently registered condominium projects.  Statistically speaking
        these "holes" are quite rare, but because they apply to newer development projects
        (that you're more likely to do searches on), they appear often enough.  
        So this is one of the areas we're currently working on smoothing over at the
        data aggregation level.
